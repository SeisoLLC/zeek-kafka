# - Try to find openssl include dirs and libraries
#
# Usage of this module as follows:
#
#     find_package(OpenSSL)
#
# Variables used by this module, they can change the default behaviour and need
# to be set before calling find_package:
#
#  OpenSSL_ROOT_DIR          Set this variable to the root installation of
#                            openssl if the module has problems finding the
#                            proper installation path.
#
# Variables defined by this module:
#
#  OPENSSL_FOUND             System has openssl, include and library dirs found
#  OpenSSL_INCLUDE_DIR       The openssl include directories.
#  OpenSSL_LIBRARIES         The openssl libraries.
#  OpenSSL_CYRPTO_LIBRARY    The openssl crypto library.
#  OpenSSL_SSL_LIBRARY       The openssl ssl library.
