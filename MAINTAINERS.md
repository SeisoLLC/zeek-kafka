# Maintainers Guide

This guide is intended for maintainers â€” anybody with commit access to the
`zeek-kafka` repository.

## Releases

All `zeek-kafka` releases first have a release candidate prior to being
promoted to general availability.

In order to create a release, you must have `pipenv` and `python3` installed,
and then run the following commands, where `$TYPE` is one of `major`, `minor`,
`patch`, `build`, or `release`.

```bash
TYPE=major
REMOTE=origin

git checkout main
git pull $REMOTE main
pipenv run invoke version $TYPE
git push --atomic $REMOTE $(git branch --show-current) $(git tag --points-at HEAD)
```

The previous commands result in a tagged commit containing updated version
references in `zkg.meta` and `README.md` (as defined in `setup.cfg`) being
pushed to GitHub, at which point GitHub actions performs the remaining release
actions based on `.github/workflows/release.yml` and
`.github/workflows/prerelease.yml`.

### Promoting a RC to GA

After a release candidate has been published for one week, assuming no new
issues have been discovered, a final release can be published. Follow the prior
steps with a `TYPE` of `release`.

If a release candidate has known issues, the maintainers can decide whether to
release anyway, or contribute additional to mitigate or resolve the issue and
increment the `build` and issue a new release candidate.

### Announcing

After creating a release or release candidate, consider announcing it to the following areas:

- The [Zeek Slack workspace](zeekorg.slack.com)
- The [Zeek user mailing list](https://lists.zeek.org/mailman3/lists/zeek.lists.zeek.org/)
- Twitter, using #Zeek and #Kafka
